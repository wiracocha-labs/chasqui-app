# Chasqui App Instructions 🏔️

This directory contains project-specific instructions and workflows for the Chasqui App.

## Project Overview
Chasqui is a decentralized communication platform designed for remote teams. It focuses on privacy and integrated productivity.

### Key Logic & Technologies
- **Blockchain**: Avalanche C-Chain.
- **Privacy Layer**: eERC20 (Encrypted ERC20) for private payments and escrow.
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Uses ZK Proofs for task verification without sensitive data exposure.
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3 (Composition API), TypeScript, Pinia, Tailwind CSS.
- **Development Environment**: Hardhat (Solidity development), Vite (Frontend bundling).

## Tech Stack Summary
- **Languages**: TypeScript, Solidity, Rust (Backend).
- **Frameworks**: Vue.js 3, Hardhat, Actix-Web.
- **Libraries**: ethers.js, OrbitDB, Pinia.

## Development Modes

### 🎨 Frontend-Only (UI/UX)
If the task is strictly about **styles, components, layout, or animations**:
- Use `npm run dev` to start Vite.
- You **do not** need to start a Hardhat node.
- The app may show connection errors in the console/UI, but you can continue working on the visual side.
- Use mocks in the frontend if logic is needed but the blockchain is inaccessible.

### ⛓️ Web3-Integrated
If the task involves **contracts, private payments, or data on-chain**:
- You **must** run `npm run start:local` (Hardhat node).
- You **must** deploy/update contracts with `npm run hardhat:deploy-and-update`.
- Use the `Web3Service` to interact with the network.

## Naming & Theme
- **Chasqui**: Named after Incan messengers. Maintain themes of speed, security, and decentralized communication.
- **Visuals**: Premium, glassmorphism, or modern dark mode aesthetics suggested by the project reviews.

## Repository Logic
- `frontend/`: All Vue.js components, views, and services.
- `web3/`: All Solidity contracts, Hardhat scripts, and tests.
- `deployments/`: Contract addresses and deployment history.
